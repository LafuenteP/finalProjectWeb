## 📋 Project Overview

DoaAí aims to simplify and organize the process of community donations.  
Through an intuitive and modern interface, users can:

- Register and log in securely using **token-based authentication**.  
- Schedule specific dates to deliver donations to registered NGOs and churches.  
- Choose between donating **clothes** or **food items**.  
- Browse through:
  - A **general catalog** of donations.
  - An **institution-specific catalog** for each NGO or church.  
- Recover forgotten passwords through a **fully functional email recovery system**.  

Although the system is **fully functional**, it is **not currently deployed online**.
